      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO: Replace this aging lore!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rupert Licky Wilde was born to Archibald Huxworth Wilde (58) and Belinda Aubrey Wilde (55) – both Australian citizens - on the 22nd of February 2028 in London, the United Kingdom. His family would include his two parents and two other siblings; the elder Renée Icky Wilde and the younger Robert Sticky Wilde. According to the family, the children’s middle names were the result of an intoxicant-fuelled bet which Archibald Wilde had lost years earlier. Their first names were, however, an attempt at humour by the elder Wilde; much to his children’s chagrin. They resided for two years within the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea; part of Greater London.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
