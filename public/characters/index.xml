      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Medical Doctor hailing from Sydney, Australia. Reserved, keeping his hand close to his chest outside of the company of his closest friends, though his service with Nanotrasen has helped him warm up to others. After his older sister, with whom he was extremely close, abruptly left home and cut-off contact, his devastation fed into the self-confidence and isolation of his youth. Yet, a fire began to burn in his belly; a raging desire to step up to the role of the selfless protector he idolised her as. Throwing himself into his studies, he accepted Nanotrasen&amp;rsquo;s patronage and entered its employ after years of grueling labour as a newly minted doctor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
