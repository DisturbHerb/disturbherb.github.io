    <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p><strong>TODO: Replace this aging lore!</strong></p>
<p>Rupert Licky Wilde was born to Archibald Huxworth Wilde (58) and Belinda Aubrey Wilde (55) – both Australian citizens - on the 22nd of February 2028 in London, the United Kingdom. His family would include his two parents and two other siblings; the elder Renée Icky Wilde and the younger Robert Sticky Wilde. According to the family, the children’s middle names were the result of an intoxicant-fuelled bet which Archibald Wilde had lost years earlier. Their first names were, however, an attempt at humour by the elder Wilde; much to his children’s chagrin. They resided for two years within the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea; part of Greater London.</p>
<p>In 2030, the family would relocate to Sydney, Australia; where they owned a home in the suburb of Parramatta. Wilde would eventually gain Australian citizenship by birthright shortly afterwards. When Wilde was 13, his elder sister Renée became a runaway due to an irreconcilable conflict between her and her parents. This event would profoundly affect the rest of his life, as the two were – despite all appearances to the contrary – very close.</p>
<p>Wilde completed his primary and secondary education in local State schools; skipping Year 4 due to academic excellence. He would attain a Certificate III in Engineering – Technical from a prominent trade college to increase his repertoire of marketable skills. After graduating from Arthur Phillip High School with an ATAR score of 95.73, he enrolled in the University of New South Wales’ combined undergraduate and postgraduate medical program in 2045.</p>
<p>In 2045, prior to his tertiary education, Wilde applied to join the NanoTrasen Pathways to Excellence program and was accepted shortly thereafter. Due to this, the Company would be obligated to cover 50% of his HECS-HELP and SA-HELP debt, but he would also be obligated to work under NanoTrasen’s employ for a term of no less than twenty years. He would officially enlist in 2051 as a Medical Doctor prior to graduating from university.</p>
<p>In 2046, Wilde was officially ordained as a Minister of the Reformed Anglican Church of Queensland; an ordination mill which freely handed out religious credentials to laity for the purposes of officiating marriages. This was precipitated due to an incident which occurred at a wedding he was slated to attend in rural New South Wales; the couple had been turned away by the local priest, an action which Wilde suspected was because the two who were to be married were both men. As a result, he himself officiated the ceremony at a civic building.</p>
<p>While undertaking tertiary study, Wilde spent 12 months with his university’s exchange program; studying at McGill University in Quebec, Canada. This period of time was self-reported as his greatest period of adversity; with an increase in workload and social isolation leading to elevated stress and malaise. During a visit to Seattle in the United States of America, he would suffer a near death experience when a 1.0m meteoroid fell from a damaged cargo freighter onto the apartment building he was staying in with his partner at the time. The resulting incident would result in the termination of his relationship and his immediate return to Sydney; where he would complete his residency at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Soon after, he graduated in December of 2052 as a Bachelor of Medical Studies and a Doctor of Medicine.</p>
<p>After finishing his post-graduate study, Wilde received his first assignment under NanoTrasen service after a brief interview with Recruitment Officer Warren Simmons; NanoTrasen Space Station 13, orbiting X-0 in the Frontier System. For a brief period of time in 2052, he was a candidate in the NanoTrasen Corporate Security Academy but was soon removed for insubordination under the orders of Prefect Helga Schulz. Though his ejection from Corporate Security would leave a black mark on his professional record, Wilde would serve with distinction as a Medical Doctor. He would continue conducting medical research during his posting and is projected to attain a promotion to Medical Director in due time.</p>
<p>Wilde currently resides with Callahan Chase Moberly and Dr. Fleur Sophie Marie DeLaCreme in Seneca, New York, United States of America. He is reputed to prefer sleeping on the floor as opposed to a normal bed, claiming that doing so is far more comfortable. His current interests include Lego – specifically BIONICLE™ - musical performance and composition, and video games. He is a regular member of the NanoTrasen Chess Society and may occasionally be found singing karaoke when adequately inebriated. From when he was 15 years old, he owned two pets; a Siberian Husky named Irwin and an orange Bengal cat named Buttermilk. They currently reside with members of Wilde’s extended family back in Sydney, Australia.</p>
