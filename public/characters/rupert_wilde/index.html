    <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>A Medical Doctor hailing from Sydney, Australia. Reserved, keeping his hand close to his chest outside of the company of his closest friends, though his service with Nanotrasen has helped him warm up to others. After his older sister, with whom he was extremely close, abruptly left home and cut-off contact, his devastation fed into the self-confidence and isolation of his youth. Yet, a fire began to burn in his belly; a raging desire to step up to the role of the selfless protector he idolised her as. Throwing himself into his studies, he accepted Nanotrasen&rsquo;s patronage and entered its employ after years of grueling labour as a newly minted doctor.</p>
<p>Rupert practically owes his entire life to the company that has given him so much. Material comfort, accelerated training, a sense of belonging, his friends, and even his wife Tammy have all stemmed from his employment with Nanotrasen. In spite of his paid loyalty, however, only so much has been able to stem his careening towards burning out. What moments of satisfaction and contentment come from his work merely punctuate the daily grind. Compassion fatigue, long hours, worsening health, a sense of stagnation.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s a strength of his character that he elects to endure; to push through with his ideals in aiding the sick and in placing others before himself. Perhaps cold indifference to all but the bottom line, pushing him to his worst self-destructive extremes, asking for more than his best efforts may prove his greatest weakness.</p>
<p>It has to be worth it. It can&rsquo;t not be.</p>
